# project-pidgeon
Allows you to type in a Cantobet message, encode it in a text form that can be sent via email. Allows you to take an encoded Cantobet text email, convert it into Cantobet letters once again.
(The project is in progress, so this is the goal of the project rather than its current functionality.)
